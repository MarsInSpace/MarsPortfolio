## Hi! My name is Mars.
I am a Game Design student, currently completing my Bachelor of Arts at HTW Berlin, Germany. Through various Game Jams and Semester Projects I have received a broad, hands-on education.

In game projects I focus on the design and improvement of Game Mechanics, Gamefeel, User Experience, analyzing and implementing the players feedback.
