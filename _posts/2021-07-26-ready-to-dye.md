Ready To Dye is a color based puzzle-game that relies on the mental flexibility of the player to solve the levels. With simple A and D controls the player interacts with the world through two player characters. The game is kept in a minimalist aesthetic to allow more focus on the single level elements, a quiet music underlining the calm nature of the game.

Due to Covid our team was restricted to Homeoffice on most days. We decided to coordinate our workflow via Miro.com and use our few in-person meetings to ideate and discuss the next steps to be taken.

I mainly worked on the 2D Art Assets of the game, creating and polishing the visual look of our project. Furthermore I helped optimize the Game Flow and Feel, as well as taking on some minor programming tasks.
This game was developed in 3 months with Unity 2D and showcased at the biannual HIVE:FIVE event at DE:HIVE Berlin.
