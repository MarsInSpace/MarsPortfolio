Slingshot is a Game that is based on high speed. The player's goal is to have as much momentum as possible, destroying all the blocks in their way and chasing up their highscore. With fast paced turns and boosts the player travels through the void in an immensely satisfying experience, supported by well thought out sound and visual design. The controls of the Radial Smash and Dash are intuitive and fast to learn, implement and combine, enabling easier maneuvering without loss of momentum.

The Wall as the antagonist in-game serves to motivate the player to become even faster. As soon as it approaches, an adrenaline boost challenges the player to keep control and escape in time, skillful movement and keeping a cool head are key.

With the Radial Smash used in the right moments, the player can maximize their level of destruction, using the tether to destroy further blocks as they rotate with increasing speed. Using the Booster Arrows in their favor, huge lines of blocks can be destroyed in one go resulting in colorful flashes and explosions.

Due to Covid our team was restricted to Homeoffice on most days. We decided to coordinate our workflow via Miro.com and use our few in-person meetings to ideate and discuss the next steps to be taken.

I was responsible for conceptualizing and designing the Core Mechanics of the game, as well as analyzing the playtests and feedback to improve and polish them. Simultaneously I worked on improving the User Experience in-game, as well as doing some minor programming tasks.
This game was developed in 3 months with Unity 3D and showcased at the biannual HIVE:FIVE event at DE:HIVE Berlin.
