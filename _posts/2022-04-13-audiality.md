# VR Auditory Exploration Experience
<p style="color:grey">This game was developed in a team of four within the Game Design BA course of DE:HIVE, HTW Berlin in a 3 week long Game Jam in the 4th semester.</p>

Audiality is a purely auditory experience that immerses the player in a wondrous, three dimensional world full of different sounds, creating an environment worth exploring. During this experience, the player will have their eyes bound, forcing them to focus entirely on their sense of hearing to discover and manipulate the space. Using the controllers of the VR equipment, they can exercise a series of intuitive movements to interact with the different sound spheres around them, spawning new sounds, destroying existing ones or trigger events that will change the entire soundscape. The journey of exploration is supposed to take around 15 minutes to explore, leaving the player entranced and enchanted after playing.

We wanted to create a playful experience which only relies on the players sense of hearing. Since most games these days focus mostly on visual feedback, we experimented with the idea of building an environment in which the primary sense is blocked off, leading to a completely new and different dynamic of gameplay.

Our base guideline was to stay in a very experimental mindset, empowering the player to make their experience with Audiality highly individual and not forcing a pre-scripted narrative.
This gave us a lot of freedom in development, however balancing and fine-tuning the game was more complex as a consequence.

The next step was creating a prototype in Unity.
Unity 3D and several VR plugins provided us with the tools necessary to set up the game.

Spheres with an Audio Source component are the physical representation of the different sounds, allowing us to manipulate them in the Editor. A vibration in the controller is indicating when one sphere is grabbed.

One random sound spawns at the start of the game, making interaction mandatory for proceeding in the experience. The more sounds are discovered, the more different effects and events can be found and interacted with. Some spheres are programmed to move in different patterns, while others just stand still, some are just an unchanging sound while others change upon interaction.

All of the features were tested right away. During development, one of us was constantly in game, making sure everything worked out as we wanted it to.

Some of the sounds we recorded ourselves, spending a day in the sound studio to get them just right.

We heavily relied on feedback all through the development process. Every other day we invited others to test our game, encouraging them to just play and think out loud so we could pinpoint the parts that were perceived as especially fun and elaborate on them further.

I worked on the conceptualization as well as the implementing and polishing of the Game Mechanics, spending a lot of time in-game during development as to find out how to make this VR experience more intuitive and have a fun and stimulating Game Feel. Additionally I edited and implemented all the sounds that we used.
