# Postcolonialism Boardgame
<p style="color:grey">This game was developed in a team of five within the Game Design BA course of DE:HIVE, HTW Berlin in a 3 week long Game Jam in the 4th semester.</p>

In Rebellations, the players try to resist the oppression of the 'Flood of Emotions'. The Flood wants to steal their positive emotions and turn them into its own negative emotions and rule over them. The goal of the players is to collect 20 emotion resources before the Flood to win the game. If they fail to do so, the opponent wins.
Rebellations is a cooperative game and relies on good communication and cooperation among the players to prevail. By reading the cards carefully, alternative ways of playing can be discovered, which can be useful during the game. The cards also have small explanatory texts printed on them that put the rules text of the cards into a historically accurate context and thus draw attention to the problems of postcolonialism.

Going into development, our goal was to create a game that is fun to play but also communicates to players that all of the things that happen in the game are quite real and remind them of the impact of colonialism that is still very much influencing peoples lives today. 
As an all white development team, we wanted to respectfully raise awareness without pretending that we understand the issues and discrimination people of color face in day to day life.

All our Cards and our Board are handmade and were crafted along the development process.

In this process I was responsible for a lot of the research as well as having a critical view on which concept was being used for the antagonist, to avoid unwanted associations or discrimination. The optimization and improvement of the flavour texts and game feel were part of my tasks as well.
This game was developed in 3 weeks and showcased at the biannual HIVE:FIVE event at DE:HIVE Berlin.
