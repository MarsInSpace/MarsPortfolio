The following illustrations and over-paintings have been made to create a feeling for a previously conceptualized world.

Setting: Berlin, 2023 - Humans have discovered the existence of the supernatural creatures of the night and have locked down the entire city in an attempt to contain the 'pest' and eliminate them before ending the quarantine.

Premise: The player takes the place of a young female Vampire, trying to defend the last stronghold of the children of the night in this city, fighting for her and her friends survival.

Atmosphere: Dystopian, Dark, Mysterious

The individual topics were:

**5 OBJECTS - BILLBOARD - VEHICLE - MAIN CHARACTER**
