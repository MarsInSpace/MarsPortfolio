# Mental Health App Concept
<p style="color:grey">This concept was developed in a team of two within the Experimental Game Design course as part of the Game Design BA of DE:HIVE, HTW Berlin in the 3rd semester.</p>

The focus and goal of this app is to provide encouragement and motivation to complete simple tasks that get the user through their day.

Through a simple reward-system and gentle aesthetics it keeps the user engaged, using previously entered and self-chosen tasks and rewards to organize the day.

Simple tasks are being displayed in the shape of water droplets that can be pulled onto the central plant to complete the task. Upon completion the user gets the choice of three different rewards that they can treat themselves to. The more tasks are being fulfilled, the more the plant grows until it is in full bloom.

The idea is that no negative feedback is given, even if no tasks are completed by the end of the day. Only positive reinforcement and the offering of a reward are supposed keep the habit going.

This project came to life after a wish for a better and more supportive app that can help people going through more difficult times. Conveniently conceptualized for Mobile, this app can also be reshaped into a less specific task-organizer.
